// Given an array of integers numbers, determine the subarray that has the highest
// product and return that product.

// A subarray is a contiguous segment of an array where all elements are taken
//  from consecutive indices, preserving their order, such as [2, 3] in [1, 2, 3, 4],
//  while non-contiguous selections like [1, 3] are not valid subarray.

// Input: numbers = [1,2,-3,5,1]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: The subarray [5, 1] has the largest product i.e 5.

// Input: numbers = [9]
// Output: 9
// Explanation: The single-element subarray [9] has the largest product i.e 9.

// Input: numbers = [1,2,0,-1,8,-4]
// Output: 32
// Explanation: The subarray [-1, 8, -4] has the largest product i.e 32.
